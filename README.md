This is an R package containing miscellaneous functions that I find useful, including those used for analyses in the multiAsCas12a manuscript (Hsiung et al., 2024). 
Functions include: 
* design of individual and pooled crRNAs
* screen analysis
* flow cytometry analysis
* general sequence manipulation
